Also in this episode, Dr. L talks about biological clocks and nutrient timing and Phil shares insights about his surgical recovery. Note, Phil is dealing with a substitute mic in this episode, which will temporarily affect his audio quality. </description>

            <description> Join Coach Stevens and Drs. Nelson and Lowery for the usual news, mail, and a discussion on changing your lifting goals.

            <title>Episode 349 IronRadio - Topic How to Be a Meathead</title>
            <description> This week the news, both in sports and in science, drives the conversation. What is a meathead? A PED user? A web-forum-dominant bodybuilder looking for followers? An anxious or suicidal power athlete? There seems to be no shortage of characteristics and behaviors that collectively apparently define this unique aspect of our sports. You may find yourself agreeing with some descriptors and vehemently opposing others. If you're a bearded, bald, bloated, hard-drinking, vain, big-eating alpha male or female, this episode may be for you! </description>

In the Topic of the Day, everyone offers thoughts on how to take advantage of high calorie foods without simply acquiring a jiggling belly.

            <title>Episode 333 IronRadio - Topic Listener Mail, Lifter Jokes</title>
            <description>This week Iron Radio gets increasingly silly. Some serious listener questions give way to lifter jokes! In the mail, speculation on mixed strength-endurance events brings about some thoughts. Then a British listener comments on the vegan article critiqued on-air recently. Afterward, questions involve bulking, periodization, and cold-hot contrast showers for recovery. The Topic of the Day then gets funny. Learn about such important topics as... How Franco Columbu is a metaphor for life, how to identify a novice bodybuilder, why powerlifting is not a sport, when to call 911 after dieting, why runners waste time, which vegan practices are questionable, and tons more! Finally, note that the fall funds drive is kicking off and the guys appreciate your support. Come on in for Iron Radio's first humor-specific topic. </description>

            <title>Episode 332 IronRadio - Topic How to Stall Progress, Bloopers</title>
            <description>Jon, Lonnie and Phil cover the usual mail and news, then get sarcastic. In the mail, a vegetarian lifter speaks up. In the news, learn what a Big Mac does to you within an hour. Then the Topic of the Day turns increasingly tongue-in-cheek. If you've ever wanted to stagnate your strength and size gains, the guys are here to help. Find out how to stall your progress in a variety of ways - program hopping, undereating, getting injured, imitating the pros - the list gets long and humorous. Then, since the discussion was brief, stick around for behind-the-scenes bloopers. These reveal the coffee slurping, tired and blunt ramblings of the co-hosts on all sorts of topics over recent months. Brace yourself, some get a little explicit!</description>

            <description>News and listener questions get addressed, then the Topic of the Day ensues. News covers curry recipes and vegan bodybuilding, and the listener question is on spinal fusion surgery for young lifters. After the mid-show break, the discussion covers support gear. Questions get answered. When should one use straps? Are belts often used incorrectly? And how do belts get used differently among muscle sports? Why do the co-hosts love sleeves? And what's up with the excessive taping trend? Tune in for facts and opinions.

            <description>Guest host Jerell Barber joins the guys for news chat and a discussion on the mental side of lifting. In the news, a blog written by Dani Shugart draws listener attention. Then Dr. Lowery offers a random mini-review of modalities that may help with muscle soreness and recovery. There are many and some are better than others, depending on the desired outcome. In the Topic of the Day, everyone looks at the Mnd-in-the-Muscle, or perhaps Mind-in-the-Movement, concept. Is it better to deeply associate with what you are doing or to dissociate? Come on in to get varying perspectives!</description>

            <description>Listener Neil Cushnie joins the guys for a discussion on muscle-related news, then has questions for everyone. In the science news and listener mail, expectations of a beefy meal affect fullness, chronic stimulant use gets scrutiny, and seemingly obvious studies are questioned. In the Topic of the Day, Biggest Gainer competitor Neil brings the inquiries. What's the best balance between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation? Why is the overhead press a lost art? And is the deadlift or squat the king of exercises? Sunday is upon us and thus so is Iron Radio!</description>

            <description>Stuntman Cale Schultz joins the guys for a discussion on muscle mass and strength in his industry. Are stuntmen just wild-eyed thrill seekers? How much training goes into what they do? And what strength sports are similar? Stuntmen have to be tough as nails on minimal recovery, so there's plenty to learn. Also tune in for news and opinion on alcohol for bodybuilders, cardiac risk assessment for heavy squatters, and new research on the anti-inflammatory supplement curcumin.

            <title>Episode 326 IronRadio - Topic Dietary Supplement Hysteria</title>
            <description>What's your stance on bodybuilding supplements? Are they a crutch for guys with masculinity and body image problems or can they be used constructively? A psych-related news report brought to the guys by licensed counselor Kelly Lowery sparks discussion. In particular, negative press on mainstream use of whey protein, creatine, and L-carnitine gets dissected. Does one need to be in serious training to justify supplement use? And what are the issues surrounding research reports by potentially biased investigators? Also in this week's episode is a follow-up on the soybean oil-obesity scare and news on a threatening obesity gene that's soon to be targeted by drug companies. Is all this too much to bear? Stay calm and keep on listening. </description>

            <description>Come on-site to a Division 1 university athletic training center to learn from Coach Bob Lemieux. Bob is the Director of Strength and Conditioning, has graduate training in nutrition and other fields relevant to athletics, and is himself a self-described meat head - at least in part. Dr. Lowery asks plenty of questions. How does university-level strength coaching differ from Internet and magazine bodybuilding? Is muscle hypertrophy the main focus? Which teams and athletes are toughest to train? What can bodybuilders learn from university-level strength coaching? And is Bob, himself inclined toward the mass gain side of the training spectrum? This week we go behind the scenes to better understand the science and art of strength and conditioning.</description>

            <title>Episode 291 IronRadio - Topic Sticky Ideas in Fitness</title>
            <description>Dr. Lowery, Coach Stevens and Dr. Nelson cover some news, then discuss the concept of sticky ideas in the fitness field.

The Topic of the Day covers what features make an idea pervasive and persistent. Some ideas in fitness are bad and just don't go away. Some ideas are good, and we can use the same principles to spread them and make them stick. It's time for your weekly dose of Iron! </description>

            <description>After sharing news on fatty acid supplements and Russian powerlifting, the guys talk with William Llewellyn. Two distinct topics get attention.

Finally, in the Enter the Fortress segment, Rob rails against the latest pro bodybuilder-turned-supplement-purveyor. Brace yourself for a little profanity, a lot of blunt opinion, and an extra long episode!</description>

            <title>Episode 271 IronRadio - Guest Dr. Chris Peters Topic Science for Lifters</title>
            <description>This week the pendulum swings toward egghead rather than meathead. Or perhaps how to use your inner egghead to become a better meathead! After recent discussions on self-publishing and changing your game, in the weight room or at the table, the guys turn to an evidence expert. Dr. Chris Peters from Sense About Science and Ask for Evidence shares advice on topics relevant to the thinking man's lifter. What constitutes good evidence? Why is our community particularly vulnerable to being bamboozled? What questions should you ask when presented with a claim? Get answers and even check out the www.SenseAboutScience.org nutrition quiz to see if you can even detect a made-up diet from one that's actually marketed. Topics herein range from CLA to amino acids to genetically modified foods and more. Come on in and become a smarter fitness consumer!</description>

            <description>Do you have to be a bit nutty to be a serious lifter? After promising to interview some psychology experts, the guys start close to home with Counselor Kelly Lowery. She's not only graduate-trained, but has been around (and lived with) bodybuilding for decades. Lots of questions and issues get addressed. Are elite athletes abnormal? Are they protected from mental disorders? What toll does chronic pain take, and why do lifters endure it while pressing on? What about aging and identity loss in long-time lifters? And what about the mania and subsequent depression that can be induced by anabolic steroids? Join in as the discussion turns to what counselors do to treat anxiety, depression, and other issues that many strength athletes face. Also get a list of cognitive errors (stinking thinking) that counselors help clients, including lifters, identify. Do YOU fall prey to any of these in your work with the iron?</description>

            <description>The Intrepid Triune is flung to the far reaches of the globe this week but the show must go on! Fortunately, execpt for a handful of regulars on the Iron Radio Facebook page, few have heard of an episode that was created, almost by accident, early this summer. When things looked darkest and the guys were sure the airwaves would go silent, Rob showed up and helped record what you are about to hear. Almost no one heard it, however, because somehow a second, full-lineup show got recorded that same week! But waste not, want not. Join Fortress and Lonnie in discussing a question that's close to all lifters' hearts - How much is too much? Enjoy!</description>

            <description>The guys cover reader mail and news, then eccentric training as the day's topic. The conversation ranges all over the place. In bodybuilding, which is better - genetics or effort? What does gifted actually mean? In powerlifting, should lifters include walk-outs with super-heavy weights? And how do the guys feel about adolescent mass training and eating? Then, the talk turns to the brutal but effective nature of eccentric training. What are the pros and cons of incorporating negatives? What do they do to muscle tissue that's so interesting? And ultimately, how can we leverage them properly for massive strength and size? Unless you're too sore to reach for your computer, it's time again for Iron Radio!  </description>

From green coffee extracts to steroid hype to valuing extreme athletes of all kinds, facts and opinions fly. How well does green coffee help one lean out? What's the mechanism?

Chad is a guy who is using his neurology background to challenge convention regarding exercise programming for lifters. How much brutality is really necessary to adequately stimulate muscle growth? If less than a 60-minute workout is required, what does that mean for weekly frequency of lifting? Can we really hasten gains by briefly training a muscle group 4, 5 or 6 times per week? And how can this be done without frying yourself? Tune in to find out! </description>

From isotope-enriched, freshly-butchered research cows to first-hand explanantions from the man doing the research himself, this episode could really surprise you! Enjoy the Christmasy science goodness! </description>

What are common mistakes that beginner or even intermediate lifters make? And perhaps more importantly, how can we address them?

How important are concepts like neuromuscular potentiation? Can a mouthpiece or other simple techniques really add a few percent to your lifts? What about periodization - what does science say about that? And in the Topic of the Day, what should we be looking out for regarding bad advice from gurus? How can we filter out the BS and use science to steer our training? Tune in and find out!

            <description>Warning: Potty-mouth guest. (Yes, YOU, Jim.) Phil, Rob and Lonnie offer some community and science news, then they dig into the mind of Jim Wendler. Questions abound for Mr. No-nonsense. Which of the three powerlifts is most affected by equipment (shirts, wraps, and suits)? How do they feel different? Where should a novice start with suits and shirts? Should you train in equipment to handle bigger weights, thus increasing your raw lifts down the road? What about injuries? When can equipment help them, if ever? And finally, can Jim SWEAR any more? Tune in and find out!

            <description>Neither holidays nor travel can hold back the titanic trio! Lonnie, Phil, and Rob discuss how different strength sports, notably bodybuilding and powerlifting, differ in how they tax an athlete and how recovery takes place.

Also, join in for some timely talk on big eats! And pay close atention to hear Rob's mellow tone; sounds like he's practicing what he preaches about staying low-key on off days.

Indeed, the original topic of the day gets postponed. Is an element of fear necessary when one faces hundreds of pounds of uncaring metal on the bar?

When does Phil know it's go time? What have Fortress and Lonnie long-eaten as a bizarre super secret pre-session ritual? What music makes Fortress want to gnaw his way through the gym door to reach some heavy weights? Get in on this!

Also tune in for a meat pie recipe that's guaranteed to pack on mass this fall season - and - listen to the discussion on lifting for its own sake.

And during the Topic of the Day, the guys talk with Paul about why bodybuilders and powerlifters get so much doping attention by the media.

If you've wondered what goes through the head of a competitor right before a competition, this will offer you insight. Fortress is friggin' strong for a clean and raw lifter but can he pull it together when under the microscope? Also, Dr. L shares some brand new news that may appear biased to some. It relates to how Strongman athletes are less healthy than runners.

            <title>Episode 118 IronRadio - Guest Jim Hearon Topic Social Networks in Fitness</title>
            <description>During a first tech-glitchy attempt at an on-site simulcast between podcasting and YouTube, Lonnie, Rob and Phil talk to gym owner Jim Hearon about the ups and downs of owning a real gym in the midst of trends and swinging economies. Is it better to go low-cost and high-volume or vice versa? How important are in-the-gym supplement sales these days? And to the point, how does a gym owner or trainer use modern marketing tools to get ahead of the 24-hour facilities in every corner of America? Should we be Tweeting, Facebooking or surfing forums to get our message out? And what's on the horizon with web 3.0? Tune in for some experienced - yet modernized - thoughts. ***PS IronRadio is now jointly airing on PRIMAL FM on Saturday nights; your radio is no longer safe. Rock on!***</description>

            <description>Dr. L is on the road and calling in to Iron Radio Headquarters. The poor audio of his lame little cell phone and laptop are evident. The guys nonetheless share news on what they're up to, what new research says about different proteins' ability to jack metabolism, and whatever else comes to mind. The talk turns to powerlifting and the natural bodybuilders who have been coming out of the woodwork with some hefty claims of 700-plus deads and 400-plus bench presses. Are these relatively little bodybuilder dudes legit? Listen to what the guys have to say.  ***PS IronRadio is now jointly airing on PRIMAL FM on Saturday nights; your radio is no longer safe.

Brace yourself for some frank discussion on how the law compares and contrasts with true ethical principles, why politicians have special vitriol for anabolic steroid users (when booze and cigarettes are so rampant and destructive), and what documentaries and real surveys have to say about steroid use. Will anabolics make you fly into a rage and slap your grandma within seconds of ingestion? On the flip side, will they make a kid look jacked without effort or risks in a matter of mere weeks? What do Ben Affleck and Captain America have to do with all this? Tune in and find out as the guys get controversial. ***PS IronRadio is now jointly airing on PRIMAL FM on Saturday nights; your radio is no longer safe. Rock on!***</description>

            <description>Lonnie, Rob and Phil talk with exercise physiologist and nutrition professional Graeme Thomas about how nutrition and exercise science get twisted around, somewhere between the original (good) science and the mistaken public message that consumers receive. Frustrated folks who are calorie counters are a good example. What else in the modern world could be making us fat? How do you narrow-down which nutrients help versus harm you or how to train?

            <description>Lonnie and Phil talk with doctoral student and strongman athlete Jonathan Mike about the science and application of various weekly training regimes.

There's a specific focus on the number of days per week one should lift.

This one can be helpful for listeners intrigued but not experienced at strength and bodybuilding competitions. From the initial trigger to get competitive to jitters the night before to how we look at the competition, to how frequently we think one should compete, there's lots of first hand advice and information here. Listen for a little smart alek Arnold parody when Dr. L gets romantic notions about his competitions. ***ALSO NOTE: IronRadio.org will be moving to recording live episodes on THURSDAYS starting at the end of August.

            <description>Phil, Lonnie and Rob talk to Naturopath Garrett Smith about a theoretical relationship between nightshade plant foods like tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant or hot pepper and joint pain and inflammation. (Many lifters are familiar with joint pain! Could you be genetically susceptible to this potential dietary influence?) This is a controversial topic that crops up every so often among lay audiences and actual mechanisms behind any problems with these fruits and veg are unknown. Plus, there are good things about these foods like potassium, fiber and even prevention of prostate cancer, so keep an open but critical mind. Lots of speculation and anecdotal evidence in this episode on a possible connection that has little documentation in the scientific literature.</description>
